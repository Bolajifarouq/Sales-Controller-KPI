Sales Dataset

I’m excited to share my latest Power BI project, completed as part of Algora's community weekly challenge! 

This dashboard dives into a sales dataset with a unique focus on time-based performance, segmented into Morning, Afternoon, and Night sales. 
Here's what the dashboard covers:
Key Metrics (KPIs):
1. Total Sales
2. Total Quantity Ordered
3. Total Number of Orders
Visuals:
1. Top 5 Selling Products
2. Top 5 Selling Cities
3. Sales Trend by Month

Each of these visualizations is segmented by time classification to provide a comprehensive view of how sales performance fluctuates throughout the day. The slicers allow for further exploration by quarters, adding an interactive element to uncover quarterly patterns.

This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of time-based sales patterns and deliver a highly segmented analysis for better business decisions. I’m thrilled with the outcome and eager to hear feedback from the community. 

Let’s connect and discuss ways data can drive smarter decisions!
